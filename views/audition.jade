								| We're looking for a variety of comfort levels with history - not everyone needs to be a scholar. You should feel comfortable playing within the genre of the time period though (so don't talk about computers in the 1800's, for example).
						li
							h3.serif-font When do you rehearse?
							p.sans-font
								| Improvised history rehearses on Tuesdays from 6:30-8:30. Locations vary depending on what's available; usually Back Bay or East Somerville.
						li
							h3.serif-font How many people are you looking to cast?
							p.sans-font Probably about 2-3.
						li
							h3.serif-font What about money?
							p.sans-font
								| This group is mainly for fun; it is not a professional ensemble. To cover rehearsal space and coaching costs, we ask folks to chip in $35 a month.
						li
							h3.serif-font What's the time commitment?
							p.sans-font
								| Weekly rehearsals (2 hrs) plus shows.
